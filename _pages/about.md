I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Mathematics, University of Ioannina, Greece under the supervision of Prof. [Charis Papadopoulos](https://www.cse.uoi.gr/~charis/). I am currently working in preparation of my thesis in **Algorithmic Graph Theory**.

Curriculum Vitae [PDF](https://stzimas.github.io/files/SpTzimas_CV.pdf)

My research interests lie broadly in **Theoretical Computer Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**, **Data Science** and **Big Data**.
