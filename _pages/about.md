I recently obtained a Ph.D. from the Department of Mathematics, University of Ioannina, Greece, where I was under the supervision of Prof. [Charis Papadopoulos](https://www.cse.uoi.gr/~charis/).
My published work is in **Algorithmic and Structural Graph Theory** and **Classical and Parameterized Complexity Theory**.
My research interests lie broadly in **Theoretical Computer Science**, **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**.
I am currently actively searching for postdoctoral opportunities.
